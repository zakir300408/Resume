\section{Summary}
\cvitem{}{
As a Machine Learning Engineer and PhD Researcher, I thrive on tackling complex problems with AI, robotics, ML algorithms, and a bit of mechanical engineering magic. My journey has taken me from developing smart, autonomous robots to diving deep into the world of reinforcement learning, wearable systems, and computer vision. I'm not just about algorithms and code; I love leading teams, especially in Machine learning projects, and I get a kick out of making projects run smoothly with a mix of SCRUM and Six Sigma. Currently, Iâ€™m on the lookout to bring my blend of academic insight and practical know-how to new challenges, ideally where I can keep pushing the boundaries of what algorithms can learn and do.
